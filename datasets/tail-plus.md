## Sequences

 In TAIL-Plus dataset, we provide more sequences with multiple loops for testing loop closure methods for long-term SLAM. Moreover, we conducted field experiments at night to extend the scene from day to night for providing visual failure scenarios.

 We released 10 sequences covering illumination change (day/night) and various surface characteristics (coarse/fine sand). 7 sequences of TAIL-Plus were recorded at night, and other 3 sequences with multiple loops were recorded during daylight.
